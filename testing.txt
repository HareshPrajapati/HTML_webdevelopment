If you're experiencing issues with images not being displayed in your README file on GitHub after changing your project's visibility from private to public, here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem:

1. **Cache Refresh:** Sometimes, web browsers store cached versions of web pages. Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser's cache and then reloading the README file.

2. **Check Image Paths:** Ensure that the paths to your images in the README file are correct. Relative paths are commonly used, but make sure they still accurately point to the image files.

3. **Image File Location:** Confirm that the image files are still in the same location within your repository and that they have been included in the public portion of your repository.

4. **GitHub Pages:** If you're using GitHub Pages to host your README, ensure that the image files are available in the GitHub Pages branch (often named `gh-pages` or `docs`).

5. **Case Sensitivity:** GitHub is case-sensitive, so make sure the image file names and their references in the README file match the case exactly.

6. **Markdown Syntax:** Verify that you're using the correct Markdown syntax for including images. Typically, it's `![Alt Text](image_url)`.

7. **Image Hosting:** If the images are hosted externally, make sure the external hosting service allows hotlinking and the images are still accessible.

8. **Public Permissions:** Double-check the permissions of the image files within your repository. They should have public access if you want them to be visible in a public repository.

9. **Third-Party Integrations:** If you're using third-party integrations or tools to manage images, ensure that they are compatible with public repositories.

10. **GitHub Support:** If none of the above steps resolves the issue, consider reaching out to GitHub support or consulting their official documentation for more assistance.

It's worth noting that GitHub's interface and features might have evolved since my last update in September 2021, so make sure to consult the most current information from GitHub's official resources.
